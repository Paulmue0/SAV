# SAV
Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer

I guess I am not the only one who came up with this idea...

+ Started working on this project because I thought it was fun to experiment with different algorithms and a nice TUI.
+ Stopped working on this project because it wasn't fun to deal with threading Issues when running the TUI and matplotlib at the same time
